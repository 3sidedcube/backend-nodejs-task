# 3 Sided Cube Backend NodeJS Task

## About

This repository contains the 3 Sided Cube backend NodeJS task. We use this to assess the capabilities of NodeJS candidates.

## Requirements

We want you to create a temperature converter using NodeJS. It needs to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

This program should be run via NodeJS's command line interpreter. It should use the [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) libary.

We would like you to use Jest to write supporting tests too.

We estimate this task should take you about an hour. Don't worry if you spend more or less time though, the end result is what we're interested to see!

## First Steps

* Create a new directory and initialise a Git repository
* Install your dependencies using NPM
* Create an entry point script
* Start writing some JavaScript!

## Scope

Things you shouldn't worry about:

* Language - If you want to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript that's great, but it's not strictly necessary.
* Environment - You can use a local version of NodeJS, NodeJS inside a Vagrant machine, or a NodeJS Docker image. Choose whatever you're most comfortable with!
* Documentation - Given the small feature set you don't need to write detailed documentation. We will be able to figure out how your program works.
* Formatting - Providing you're consistent with your approach, any formatting style is fine.
* Builds - You don't need to spend any time integrating build tools with repository. Automatic linting or test runners aren't required.

## Submission

Simply create a public Git repository on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. Then push your work to it and send us the link.

Alternatively, you can create a private Git repository on GitHub. Once you've pushed your work to it just add `ty3sc` as a collaborator.
